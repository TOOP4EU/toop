# Code lists

This folder contains the TOOP code lists for:
* Participant identifier schemes

## Version history

* v1 - work in progress

## Usage notes

It is important to note that this is a dynamic list. Over time new services will be added. Developers should take this into account when designing and implementing solutions for TOOP services.

### Participant Identifier Schemes

Rows marked as "deprecated" should not be used for newly issued documents, as the respective identifier scheme is no longer active/valid. Deprecated scheme IDs may however not be reused for different agencies as existing exchanged documents may refer to them.

### Document types

Rows marked as "deprecated" should not be used for newly issued documents.

### Processes

Rows marked as "deprecated" should not be used for newly issued documents.
